# Frontend
Frontend will have two components. What the users will see and what I will see as a developer.

### User Frontend
1. A read page with info about all post in home page and don't add categories rn. Will do that later
2. As for us, when I login we will have a separate page to interact with the website like an admin dashboard. Where I can create the posts and also see all users. 
3. Ban users

# Backend
1. Add a comment section and for that we need to authenticate users
2. Add a weekly letter kinda thing
3. Delete account
4. unsubscribe from letter kinda thing
